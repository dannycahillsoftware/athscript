# Solana Token All-Time-High script

This repo contains a simple script that allows you to get the all time high value of some Solana Tokens from the CoinGecko API. The graphic interface is all in the terminal. 

Limitations: CoinGecko only lists a subset of all tokens launched. I'm trying to make this script more robust by interfacing with a different API that has data about all coins.
